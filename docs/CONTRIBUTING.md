## 📌 Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository**

2. **Create a feature branch**

```
git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name
```

3. **Make your changes**

- Write clean, modular code
- Follow strict TypeScript rules (`no any`, `no null`, etc.)
- Use descriptive function names and comments
- Keep frontend logic and UI components separated

4. **Run lint and tests**

```
npm run lint
npm run test
```

5. **Commit using the standard format**

```
(feature: action) short description
```

**Examples:**
```
(auth: add) JWT middleware for protected routes
(resume: fix) correct date formatting in PDF export
(docs: update) add ATS scoring explanation
```

6. **Push your branch**

```
git push origin feature/my-feature-name
```

7. **Open a pull request (PR)**

- Provide a clear title and description
- Reference any related issue IDs
- Use GitHub checklists to show what's completed

## 🔐 Rules for Authenticated Routes

- All protected routes must verify JWT tokens via middleware
- Never leak sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys)
- Use environment variables for all config values

---

## ✅ Code Style

- Tabs: 2 spaces
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode)
- Component Style: Functional + Hooks
- Avoid: `any`, `null`, `unknown`, or magic numbers
- Use `AuthContext` and props for all stateful components
- Keep database logic out of controllers (use services)

---

## 📂 Docs & Markdown

- All new features must be documented in `/docs/`
- Use 110% Markdown only (no syntax highlighting, no mixed formats)
- Keep files under 500 lines each when possible
- Avoid emojis inside code blocks or logic output
