## üßæ Synopsis

CVitaePRO is a next-generation, AI-powered platform that empowers job seekers to generate polished, professional, and recruiter-ready resumes and cover letters in minutes ‚Äî not hours. Built to bridge the gap between human potential and hiring system algorithms, CVitaePRO streamlines the document creation process using GPT-4o, the most advanced natural language model available from OpenAI.

Traditional resume writing is time-consuming, overwhelming, and often misses the mark when it comes to modern hiring systems. Most applicants either struggle to express their value clearly or fail to format their documents for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), resulting in missed opportunities and automated rejections.

CVitaePRO eliminates those barriers by combining personalized AI content generation, real-time ATS optimization, and a dynamic user interface. Users can upload an existing resume or start from scratch using the platform‚Äôs guided form builder. As they input their experience, education, and skills, GPT-4o generates clean, well-structured content tailored to their target role or industry.

But CVitaePRO goes beyond writing. It simulates real-world ATS filters, parsing the resume and scoring it against actual job descriptions to detect keyword gaps, formatting issues, and content mismatches. Users receive actionable feedback in real time ‚Äî with clear suggestions on how to improve their ATS score and increase recruiter visibility.

Each resume is editable before export, allowing users to refine their content using a flexible, WYSIWYG editor. Cover letters can also be generated using similar inputs, ensuring consistent tone, branding, and relevance across application materials.

Security is central to the platform. CVitaePRO uses JWT-based authentication and bcrypt hashing to safeguard user data. Resumes and cover letters are stored in a PostgreSQL database, with Redis caching and API rate limiting in place to reduce cost and abuse while maintaining performance.

Whether you‚Äôre a first-time applicant or a seasoned professional tailoring documents for a career pivot, CVitaePRO delivers the tools, intelligence, and flexibility to stand out ‚Äî not blend in.

In an age where AI-written resumes are the new normal, CVitaePRO ensures yours is better written, better structured, and built to be seen.

## üìò About

Writing a resume shouldn‚Äôt feel like an impossible task ‚Äî but for many job seekers, it is. From figuring out the right structure to choosing the right words and meeting recruiter expectations, most people struggle to present their experience in a way that‚Äôs clear, compelling, and competitive. On top of that, automated Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) filter out poorly formatted or keyword-weak resumes before they‚Äôre ever seen by a human.

**CVitaePRO eliminates that friction.**

This platform combines the intelligence of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o with an intuitive, user-friendly interface to help applicants create highly tailored, recruiter-ready resumes and cover letters ‚Äî instantly. Whether you're uploading an existing resume or starting from scratch, CVitaePRO analyzes your input, rewrites it for clarity and impact, and formats it for both readability and ATS compliance.

Users receive real-time feedback on formatting, keyword coverage, and structure. The built-in ATS simulation identifies how well a resume aligns with a specific job description and provides actionable suggestions to improve the score.

With features like secure document storage, export to PDF/DOCX, guided resume-building steps, and smart customization, CVitaePRO helps users focus on what matters: landing the interview.

Whether you‚Äôre applying to your first job or your fiftieth, CVitaePRO empowers you to present your best self ‚Äî clearly, confidently, and effectively.

## üß† ATS Algorithm Overview

CVitaePRO‚Äôs ATS scoring logic works in three phases:

**1. Resume Parsing**
```
import cheerio from 'cheerio';

function parseResume(htmlResume: string) {
  const $ = cheerio.load(htmlResume);
  return {
    name: $('h1').text(),
    email: $('a[href^="mailto:"]').text(),
    phone: $('a[href^="tel:"]').text(),
    experience: $('section#experience').text(),
    education: $('section#education').text(),
    skills: $('section#skills').text()
  };
}
```

**2. Keyword Matching**
```
function matchKeywords(resumeText: string, jobDescription: string): number {
  const jobKeywords = jobDescription.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+\b/g) || [];
  const resumeWords = resumeText.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+\b/g) || [];

  let matches = jobKeywords.filter(word => resumeWords.includes(word)).length;
  return (matches / jobKeywords.length) * 100;
}
```

**3. ATS Score Calculation**
```
function calculateATSScore(keywordMatch: number, formattingErrors: string[]): number {
  let score = keywordMatch * 0.90;
  score -= formattingErrors.length * 5;
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(score, 100));
}
```
